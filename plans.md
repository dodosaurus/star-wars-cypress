This is experimental Cypress API project to test out what is possible.

### What this project should contain

- some reporting tool, like Mochawesome, but better trying something newer, nicer (Allure?)
- libray of REST calls, somehow easily transfered (do some export-import tool exist?) from Postman for ex., not typed by hand
- some enhanced utility library (find some predefined, bot not very big, rather define my own tools with more and more tests; faker?)
- minimize using static data in fixtures, but if needed use it; rather do each test selfexplanatory
- try to do GitHub Actions integration
