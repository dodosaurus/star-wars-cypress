This is experimental Cypress API project to test out various npm packages/reporters/new practices.

### What this project should contain

[] some reporting tool, like Mochawesome, but better trying something newer, nicer (Allure?)
[] library of REST calls, somehow easily transfered (do some export-import tool exist?) from Postman for ex., not typed by hand
[] some enhanced utility library (find some predefined, bot not very big, rather define my own tools with more and more tests; faker?)
[] minimize using static data in fixtures, but if needed use it; rather do each test selfexplanatory
[] try to do GitHub Actions integration
