Cypress plugin for effective API testing. Imagine Postman, but in Cypress.
</p>

### Installation

Install this package:
```bash
npm i cypress-plugin-api

// or

yarn add cypress-plugin-api
```

Import the plugin into your `cypress/support/e2e.js` file:
```js
import 'cypress-plugin-api'
// or
require('cypress-plugin-api')
```

### Usage
You can now use `cy.api()` command. This command works exactly like `cy.request()` but in addition to calling your API, it will print our information about the API call in your Cypress runner.

### Features
- view responses in UI frame as well as in the timeline
- showing query objects, headers, request body and response
- color coding of methods
- copy response to clipboard (works for last test only)
- snapshots

#### Snapshot only mode
If you want to combine your API calls with your UI test, you can now use `snapshotOnly` mode, that will hide the plugin UI view after command ends. You can access it within the timeline.

`snapshotOnly` mode is set to `false` by default. To set up `snapshotOnly` mode, add following to your test configuration:

```js
it('my UI & API test', { env: { snapshotOnly: true } }, () => {

  cy.visit('/') // open app
  cy.api('/item') // call api
  cy.get('#myElement') // still able to access element on page

})
```

or you can add the configuration to your `cypress.config.{js,ts}` file:
```js
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress'

export default defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
    },
    env: {
      snapshotOnly: true
    }
  },
})
```

#### Hiding credentials
You can hide your credentials by passing `hideCredentials` option to your env configuration. This will hide all the credentials from UI, but you can still access them via console. This option is set to `false` by default.

```js
it('my secret test', { env: { hideCredentials: true } }, () => {

  cy.api({
      url: '/',
      headers: {
        authorization: Cypress.env('myToken')
      }
    })

})
```

The result will look like this:
